= Release 0.3 (WIP) =
== New Features ==
 * Better generic support all together
 * Better javadoc
 * ExtendedCollection is now super interface of FluentList and FluentSet. Both now
 implement containsAny, and several varargs facilities of Collection methods.
 * FluentSet now have all set operations, without collateral effect.
 * Enumerable.take, Enumerable.any
 * FluentList.flatten
 * FluentUtils.aSet and FluentUtils.aList, create the collections disregarding type
 safety. Usefull for creating set of sets or list of lists, or set of lists of sets of
 maps, and so on.

=== Method Aliases ===
 * Closure.as is alias to Closure.toInterface
 * Fluentutils.call is alias to Fluentutils.my
 * Enumerable.findAll is alias to Enumerable.select

== Breaking Changes ==
 * Fluent Collections no longer extend java.util classes. That is: Sequence does not
 extend ArrayList, Dictionary does not extend HashMap, and ExtendedSet does not extend
 HashSet.
 * ClosureOfAString renamed to ClosureOfAMethodName. Just to make things clearer, although
 the prefered way is to always call ClosureCoercion.toClosure.

= Release 0.2.1 =
== New ones ==
 * _my_ is callable as static method on fluent Utils
 * Closure of a String now differs arity overloded methods and can call varargs.
 * Hamcrest matchers supported! They coerce to closure now.
 * Convenient methods to create callables, runnables and threads from a closure.
 * Range and IRange from python down to Java. On !FluentUtils, ubiquous facade.

== Breaking Changes ==
 * Pair moved from iterators to collections package.
 * All factory methods from Sequence, Dictionary, Pair, etc, moved to a new Facade: !FluentUtils.

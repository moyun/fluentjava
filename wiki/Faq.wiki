#Frequently_anticipated_questions

== What is this _type parameters of <T>T cannot be determined; no unique maximal instance exists for type variable T with ..._ error?==
This can usually happen when using generic methods with primitives or generic types. For instance:

{{{
E e = closure.invoke();
booean bol = closure.invoke();
}}}

Eclipse compile allows it, but javac doesn't. Some ways around this:

 * Specify the type:
{{{
E e = closure.<E>invoke();
booean bol = closure.<Boolean>invoke();
}}}
 * This only applies to primities, as they can't be generic types: do not use autoboxxing:

{{{
Booean bol = closure.<Boolean>invoke();
}}}

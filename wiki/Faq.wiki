#summary Frequently anticipated questions

== So many nice static methods! But how to ease the development, instead of writting static imports all the time? ==
Eclipse (since Europa) support favourite static imports. It allows you to auto complete static methods of a class even when you haven't imported the class (it adds them to the autocomplete list automatically). For this, go to Preferences -> Java -> Editor -> Content Assist -> Favourites. More on this, including some pics, [[http://www.ralfebert.de/blog/eclipseide/static_methods/ here].

== What is this _type parameters of `<`T`>`T cannot be determined; no unique maximal instance exists for type variable T with ..._ error?==
This can usually happen when using generic methods with primitives or generic types. For instance:

{{{
E e = closure.invoke();
booean bol = closure.invoke();
}}}

Eclipse compile allows it, but javac doesn't. Some ways around this:

 * Specify the type:
{{{
E e = closure.<E>invoke();
booean bol = closure.<Boolean>invoke();
}}}

 * This only applies to primities, as they can't be generic types: do not use autoboxxing:
{{{
Booean bol = closure.<Boolean>invoke();
}}}

#summary Features to be Implemented
#labels backlog
= To Be Released =
 * immutable fluent set operations
 * Builtin Common Closures (besides _my_)
 * Batch processing: map#valuesAt, varargs set#contains and list#contains
 * [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schwartzian_transform Schwartzian_transform] on sort_by.

= Collection Theme =
 * A lot more Extended  Collections (curryed ones, like ruby 1.9, sortBy, partition, and lazy collect, lazy map, max, min etc): ??? points
 * Wrapped extended collections: 9 points
 * Wrapped over Fork Join: 10 points

= Closures Theme =
 * Full Coercion. Includes detecting [http://docs.google.com/View?docid=k73_1ggr36h& SAMs] generated from Abstract Classes instead of Interfaces. [http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla/source/js/rhino/src/org/mozilla/javascript/NativeJavaMethod.java This] is how Rhino (javascript scripting in java) handled overloaded methods (important to closure of a string): 10  points
 * !TimeIt: 4  points
 * Compose: 6 points
 * Curry: 1 point


= To think about it (need points and priorization) =
 * Convience methods: enumerable#createWithMap, enumerable#toMap (from pairs)
 * Softening exceptions (on Closure)
 * Aspectj Aspect to make things like _my_ callable from static methods without one single argument (for those who won't/can't/don't like/don't feel like it/are grossed out about extending a third party class).
 * Arithmethic operations (smalltalk inspiration, again) on enumerable
 * Partition and iterablePartition on list (ruby calls this group_by, influenced by smalltalk's groupBy:having:)
 * Ruby's hash constructor (maybe extended interface on map, as the defaults do not allow this):
{{{
Hash.new => hash
Hash.new(obj) => aHash
Hash.new {|hash, key| block } => aHash
}}}
 * Look into using [http://codeworker.free.fr/ codeworker] or [http://www.janino.net/ janino] to enable _eval_, and make closures out of it.
 * cache to o closure of a string based on signature.
 * Use wrapped fluent lists, sets and maps whenever lists, sets and maps would otherwise be returned.
 * CharSequence to enumerable
